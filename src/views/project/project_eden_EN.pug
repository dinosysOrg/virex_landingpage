          ‘The Eden Rose’ got its name from the French architect Francois Barberot. The project consists of 52 semi-detached villas and 181 terraced houses,
           built and designed in a luxurious neo-classical style with a hint of modernity</br>
           Housing sizes range from 82-218m2 for the 181 terraced houses and 130-300m2 for the 52 semi-detached and lone-standing villas.
            The shophouses are located directly on the main road to make it easier to reach customers and residents. Stairs are arranged
             along the length of the shophouses to help reduce the required space, as well as to increase ventilation for the homes so the
              owner can operate their business more effectively/offer the space for rent.
